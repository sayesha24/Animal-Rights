      <p>What do you say when you are in pain? <br> Ouch perhaps? <br> but have you ever thought about what would these voiceless animals say when they are in pain?</p>
      <p>But hopefully, the Indian government has established certain laws and acts that prevent animal cruelty.</p>

      <h4> Animal Rights and Laws with Consequences:</h4> <br>

        6. Stray dogs that have been operated for birth control cannot be captured or relocated by anybody including any authority.<br><br>
        7. Not providing a pet with the elements important for survival including access to food, water and shelter <br>and keeping the pet chained for hours can lead to imprisonment. <br><br>
        8. Monkeys cannot be owned.<br><br>

        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Such laws created by the Indian government under various acts can truly help strengthen and improve the relationship <br>between the nature/ environment and the mankind.

         <br><br> <h4>How our Future Would Look like if Animal Cruelty Continued</h4>
        <br>If animal cruelty continues in any form then,
        <br> we will soon see a world buzzing with the city sounds rather than the chirping of the birds, 
        <br>a trail of cars and buildings instead of the lush trees 
        <br>and a handful of insects occupying the confined forests with half cut trees.
         <br><br> Hence, these rights will aid the animals to have a compartively easier survival in this daunting world and make us, <br>the responsible citizens of India realise our duty towards these innocent and vulnerable species. </p>
